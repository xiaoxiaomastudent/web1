                Public transportation in Florence is widely used. Buy your tickets before you<br>
                board the bus, as the bus driver does not check tickets but you need to put your<br>
                ticket in "ticket validating" machine. You can buy tickets from the driver but they<br>
                cost more. Usually, people buy tickets at local tobacco shops and small stores<br>
                with "T" sign.
